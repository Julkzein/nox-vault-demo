/**
 * @dev Confidential adaptation of EIP-7540 (asynchronous tokenized vault).
 *
 * Reference: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540
 *
 * Flow differences from the plaintext EIP-7540:
 *  - All amounts are encrypted (`euint256`). Only the vault's Ownable `owner()` can observe
 *    per-user pending and claimable amounts (via the Nox ACL). Per-user operators (ERC-7984
 *    delegation) cannot.
 *  - `REQUEST_ID` is a constant (`0`) — EIP-7540's "singleton" mode where each user has at most
 *    one pending request and one claimable request per flow. A second `requestDeposit` before
 *    approval simply accumulates in the same bucket (state stays a `mapping(address controller
 *    => euint256 amount)`, no nested `mapping` on request id).
 *
 * TODO(prod):
 *  - Multi-request mode (unique `requestId` per call), needed if users should be able to cancel
 *    individual requests, if different NAV snapshots must be locked per request, or if per-lot
 *    metadata is required. Storage becomes
 *    `mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => euint256))` and views take the `requestId` back.
